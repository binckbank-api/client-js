## <a name="onboarding"></a>Onboarding process for developers

### How to start

If you are not interested in developing software, but want to use the API in Excel, visit the [README for that example project](https://github.com/binckbank-api/client-excel#realtime-quotes-in-excel "Use Binck OpenApi with realtime quotes in Excel").

Otherwise, continue reading and contact Binck with the announcement you want to develop an application using the API.\
This can be done by submitting [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nKeZuuhuoEGdeKUD8EWjg-9UHL_YoBNNuZbAQHvFJJhUOFA3NTZaMVNIVUZLUFpPTjg2Q04zVTBDVi4u "Form to request a client able to connect with the OpenApi"), where you can enter the details of the application. Important are the name of the application, the required scopes (ordering, quotes, news, or only viewing) and the redirect URL. This is the URL used to redirect the user to, after signing in.

### Next step

The API team at Binck will create a new clientId and secret with the requested privileges and sends them to you, together with a test account. The environment to test the application is sandbox. You cannot test with a real account, so orders won’t be executed on the market.

### <a name="links"></a>Important links

Request access to the OpenApi with [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=nKeZuuhuoEGdeKUD8EWjg-9UHL_YoBNNuZbAQHvFJJhUOFA3NTZaMVNIVUZLUFpPTjg2Q04zVTBDVi4u "Form to request a client able to connect with the OpenApi").

Documentation of the individual endpoints can be found on [developers.binck.com](https://developers.binck.com "OpenApi endpoint description").

Example code and login guide can be found on Github. Great, you are here.

Releases and status updates are communicated via Twitter handle [@BinckOpenApi](https://twitter.com/BinckOpenapi "BinckOpenApi on Twitter").

Twitter can also be used for questions, or our email address [openapi@binck.nl](mailto:openapi@binck.nl "OpenApi email support").\
Some questions already have an answer in the [Wiki](https://github.com/binckbank-api/client-js/wiki "GitHub Wiki").

## <a name="logon"></a>Sign in to Binck API using OAuth2

The Binck API is accessible with a rest API protected with OAuth2.
> “The authorization code grant is used when an application exchanges an authorization code for an access token. After the user returns to the application via the redirect URL, the application will get the authorization code from the URL and use it to request an access token. This request will be made to the token endpoint.”

More info: <https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/>

Prerequisites:

- An application id with secret, realm, scope(s) and redirect URL, supplied by Binck.

Binck has a test environment, called sandbox, and a production environment. Both have an authentication provider and an API endpoint.
The authentication provider uses the OAuth2 "authorization code" flow.\
For this example we use the sandbox environment, with predefined test users and passwords.

### <a name="logon1"></a>Step 1: Sign in

Create a 'Log in' link sending the user to:

`https://login.sandbox.binck.com/am/oauth2/realms/{realm}/authorize?ui_locales={LOCALE}&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&scope={SCOPES}&state={1234zyx}&response_type={code}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}`

**realm** – The bincknlapi realm is used for the Dutch Binck customers\
**ui_locales** - The language to be used for the login pages, examples: fr, it, or nlBE\
**scope** - One or more scope values (separated by space), indicating which parts of the user's account you wish to access, examples are read, write, news, quotes\
**state** - A random string generated by your application, which you'll verify later\
**code** - Indicates that your server expects to receive an authorization code\
**client_id** - The client ID you received when you first created the application\
**redirect_uri** - Indicates the URI to return the user to after authorization is complete

Don't forget to encode the URL parameters (from '`http://localhost/binck`' to '`http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fbinck`').

The user sees the login dialog:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binckbank-api/client-js/master/doc/login-italian-realm.png)

Skipping entering the validation code (SMS challenge) results in a readonly session. Placing orders won’t be allowed, even if the application requested 'write' scope.

### <a name="logon2"></a>Step 2: Retrieve authorization code

After logging in, the user sees a dialog to give access to the thirdparty, if access is not already granted. In order to authorize, the user must login with the validation code (2FA).

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binckbank-api/client-js/master/doc/consent-italian-realm.png)

If the user allows access, the service redirects the user back to your site (the _redirect_uri_) with an auth code in the query string.

`https://{REDIRECT_URI}/?code={AUTH_CODE_HERE}&scope={SCOPES}&state={1234zyx}`

**code** - The server returns the authorization code in the query string\
**state** - The server returns the same state value that you passed\
**scope** - One or more scopes granted

You should first compare this state value to ensure it matches the one you started with. You can typically store the state value in a cookie, and compare it when the user comes back. This ensures your redirection endpoint isn't able to be tricked into attempting to exchange arbitrary authorization codes.

#### Error logging in

If the login failed, the error is returned in the query string.

`https://{REDIRECT_URI}/?error_description=Resource%20Owner%20did%20not%20authorize%20the%20request&state=**1234xyz**&error=access_denied`

This is an example of the error when the user denied access for your application.

### <a name="logon3"></a>Step 3: Retrieve token

With the code the application can request the token.

```http
POST https://login.sandbox.binck.com/am/oauth2/realms/{realm}/access_token
grant_type=authorization_code
client_id=CLIENT_ID
client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET
redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
code=AUTH_CODE_HERE
```

The request requires a header "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

**realm** - The realm to identify the customer group, for example binckitapi\
**grant_type** - The grant type for this flow is authorization_code\
**client_id** - The client ID you received when you first created the application\
**client_secret** - The password of this client\
**redirect_uri** - Must be identical to the redirect URI provided in the original link\
**code** - This is the code you received in the query string

Because this request contains your secret, it cannot be done in javascript, or any other client side application.

The response will contain:

```javascript
{
    "access_token": "5af56faa-8cd9-466b-81b1-5f2eadafca1f",
    "refresh_token": "dcdd4c1e-4241-405f-ae1c-2dc14e31d895",
    "scope": "read write quotes news",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3599
}
```

**access_token** – The token to be used when calling the API\
**expires_in** - The time in seconds the token will be valid\
**refresh_token** – The token used to request a new access_token, just before token expiry\
**scope** – The requested scope, for example “read write”\
**token_type** – You retrieved a Bearer token

The expiry time is one hour. However, if there are no requests in 30 minutes, the session will expire as well (idle time = 30 minutes).

#### Error retrieving code

If there is a problem receiving the code, an error will be returned. If there is no problem with the connection, the auth server responds with an error object in this format:

```javascript
{
    "error_description": "Client authentication failed",
    "error": "invalid_client"
}
```

### <a name="logon4"></a>Step 4: First API request

The token grants access to the API. For example, to get the accounts of the user.

Before proceeding, the API connection can be tested without token, by using the version endpoint.

<https://api.sandbox.binck.com/api/v1/version>

This GET request returns, if directly requested, a json response with the build date and version of the API.

```http
GET https://api.sandbox.binck.com/api/v1/version
```

```javascript
{
    "Accept": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    "Authorization": "Bearer ", +  ACCESS_TOKEN
}
```

**access_token** - The token retrieved in step 3

Endpoint:
`https://api.sandbox.binck.com/api/v1/accounts`

The request is granted access if the token is supplied.

The complete API description can be found at <https://developers.binck.com>.

#### Error getting data

The errors are returned in a uniform layout.

```javascript
{
    "developerMessage": "Unauthorized",
    "endUserMessage": "Non sei autorizzato.",
    "errorCode": "Unauthorized",
    "errorId": "unknown"
}
```

**developerMessage** – A notification for the developer of the app. Not meant to be shown to end users\
**endUserMessage** – A translated error, in the language of the end user, to show to the end user\
**errorCode** – A code, which can be used for development\
**errorId** – If applicable, an error id to report back to Binck, for trouble shooting

### <a name="logon5"></a>Step 5: Refresh token

The token request contains an expiration time. After this time, the token is no longer valid.\
So, before the token expires, a new token must be requested. For this, we have a refresh token.

```http
POST https://login.sandbox.binck.com/am/oauth2/realms/{realm}/access_token
grant_type=refresh_token
client_id=CLIENT_ID
client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET
refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE
```

**realm** - The realm to identify the customer group, for example binckitapi\
**grant_type** - The grant type to refresh a token is refresh_token\
**client_id** - The client ID you received when you first created the application\
**client_secret** - The password of this client\
**refresh_token** – The token received when requesting the initial token

As with the initial token retrieval, this request is not allowed from any client application hosted on the customers machine.

The response is the same as the initial token request. See [step 3](#logon3).

For realtime streams, see [documentation on realtime refresh](#realtime5) on how to inject the new token to that connection.

### <a name="logon6"></a>Step 6: Testing

The sandbox functionality can be compared with the website. The website with the same data as sandbox can be accessed using these URLs:

- Binck BE: <https://web.sandbox.binck.be/logon/>
- Binck FR: <https://web.sandbox.binck.fr/logon/>
- Binck IT: <https://web.sandbox.binck.it/logon/>
- Binck NL: <https://web.sandbox.binck.nl/logon/>

### <a name="logon7"></a>Step 7: Production

The production environment is the same as sandbox, but, with real customers and live data.\
The application is can go to production when development is finished and the application is thouroughly tested on sandbox. This is only for individual usage.\
When the application is used by more accounts than yours, Binck requires a thirdparty agreement.

Use these URL’s:
`https://login.binck.com/am/oauth2/`\
`https://api.binck.com/api/v1/`

#### Releases

If there is a release and there is a need to set the Binck backend in maintenance, this error message is returned for every request:

```javascript
{
    "DeveloperMessage": "Temporary maintenance mode",
    "EndUserMessage": "BinckBank is currently down for planned maintenance. We expect to be back in a couple of hours. Thanks for your patience.",
    "ErrorCode": "ServiceUnavailable",
    "ErrorId": 503
}
```

Your application must be able to handle this error message.

#### Documentation

The description of the available endpoints is located here: <https://developers.binck.com>, and an example of a client written in javascript can be found here: <https://github.com/binckbank-api/client-js/>.

### <a name="logonSuggestions"></a>Things to keep in mind developing the API

1. Never ever leak the secret. Don’t put in in frontend code.
2. The secret will change periodically, keep it in a controlled environment.
3. The customer login is on person level. This means if a customer has more than one account, the customer might need to select the account to use for the application. There are multiple account types, not all account types have trading options (example is the savings account).
4. Request small portions of data, using paging. If you must display 10 transactions, request ten transactions.
5. When placing an order, comply with the rules. Show the KID document if available, give an option to display ex ante costs.
6. Be prepared for error messages. Never display the developer message, but your own one. Developer messages are for logging and trouble shooting.
7. End user messages must be shown, they are in the locale language of the customer.
8. When the systems of Binck are down, the error message is stating this. Sign in page shows a maintenance page.
9. When requesting the login page, supply the locale of the customer. If not, the fallback might not be the desired language of the country.
10. Instrument ids might change overnight. When caching, keep this in mind.
11. The API has a limit of 50 requests per minute. If exceeded, the customer might be logged out, resulting in an UnAuthorized response.
12. We respect a REST convention that trailing slashes are not allowed, so `https://api.sandbox.binck.com/api/v1/accounts` is the correct notation.
13. Orders on sandbox won't go to the market. If you need a (partial) execution, send us an email with the details of the order you want to be executed.

## <a name="realtime"></a>Get realtime data using the Binck API

This document describes the realtime feed available for customers.

The library used to push data is SignalR:
> ASP.NET Core SignalR is an open-source library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps. Real-time web functionality enables server-side code to push content to clients instantly.

Communication is done using WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or Long Polling. SignalR automatically chooses the best transport method that is within the capabilities of the server and client.

More info: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr>.

For SignalR are client libraries available in Java, Javascript and .NET. In this example Javascript is used, with the NPM package here: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aspnet/signalr>.

Prerequisites:

- A token retrieved using the OAuth2 Authentication flow, as described in the chapter [Logon to Binck API using Oauth2](#logon).

Scopes:

- quotes (for instrument prices)
- news (for news)
- read and/or write (for order updates)

Binck has a test environment (sandbox) and a production environment. Both have the realtime feed.

For this example we use the sandbox environment, with predefined test users and passwords.

### <a name="realtime1"></a>Step 1: Connect to the feed

The instruction for creating the client can be found here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/javascript-client>.

The following code creates and starts a connection:

```javascript
var options = {
    accessTokenFactory: function () {
        var accessToken = "{TOKEN_RETRIEVED_FROM_LOGIN.BINCK.COM}";
        console.log("AccessToken used in streamer request: " + accessToken);
        return accessToken;
    }
};
connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
.withUrl("https://realtime.sandbox.binck.com/stream/v1", options)
.configureLogging(signalR.LogLevel.Information) // Might be 'Trace' for testing
.build();
```

**accessToken** – The Bearer token\
**url** - The URL of the realtime channel

### <a name="realtime2"></a>Step 2: Handle connection changes

The user might stop the connection. Or something can go wrong with the server. Then the application might do a reconnect, or just show this to the user.

The following code configures the event:

```javascript
connection.onclose(function () {
    console.log("The connection has been closed.");
    alert("disconnected");
});
```

### <a name="realtime3"></a>Step 3: Start the connection

The following code starts the connection:

```javascript
connection.start()
.then(function () {
    console.log("The streamer has been started.");
})
.catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error);
});
```

That’s it. The application is now ready to subscribe to messages.

### <a name="realtime4"></a>Step 4: Subscribe to data

#### News

News can differ per account. For example, asset management accounts see different messages than trading accounts.

In general, news is English, or in the locale of the customer.

Required scope: “news”.

Configure the callback using this code:

```javascript
connection.on("News", function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

Create the subscription for the account using this code:

```javascript
connection.invoke("SubscribeNews", accountNumber)
.then(function (subscriptionResponse) {
    if (subscriptionResponse.isSucceeded) {
        console.log("Subscribed to news.");
    } else {
        console.log("Error. Is accountNumber valid for this session?");
    }
})
.catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error);
});
```

Stop listening to the news broadcast can be achieved by invoking UnSubscribeNews (no account number).

#### Quotes

Quotes are not always realtime. This differs based on the subscription of the customer for realtime feeds on certain markets. If there is no realtime subscription, quotes are delayed, but still streaming.
There is a limit on the number of quotes to subscribe, of 3.000. And to the number of instruments to be added to the subscription. Blocks per subscription update must be at most 100.

Required scope: “quotes”.

Configure the callback using this code:

```javascript
connection.on("Quote", function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

Create the subscription for the account using this code:

```javascript
connection.invoke(
    "SubscribeQuotes",
    accountNumber,
    instrumentIds,  // Array of instrumentsIds
    quoteSubscriptionLevel
)
.then(function (subscriptionResponse) {
    if (subscriptionResponse.isSucceeded) {
        console.log("Succeeded, instrument #: " + subscriptionResponse.subcount);
    } else {
        console.log("Error. Is accountNumber valid for this session?");
    }
})
.catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error);
});
```

The instrumentIds must be an array of instrumentIds.

SubscriptionLevel is one of these values:

```javascript
var QuoteSubscriptionLevel = {
    // Retrieve only the last, high, low, cumulative volume and open prices.
    TRADES: "Trades",
    // In addition to trades, retrieve the bid1 and ask1 of the book.
    TOPOFBOOK: "TopOfBook",
    // In addition to trades, retrieve the full book, if available.
    BOOK: "Book"
};
```

In the response the number of subscriptions is returned. Use this to validate if there are not to many instruments in the subscription. This might make the connection slow.

Stop listening to the quote broadcast can be achieved by invoking UnSubscribeQuotes (no account number).

```javascript
connection.invoke(
    "UnSubscribeQuotes",
    instrumentIds  // Array of instrumentsIds
)
.then(function (subscriptionResponse) {
    if (subscriptionResponse.isSucceeded) {
        console.log("Unsubscribe succeeded, instrument #: " + subscriptionResponse.subcount);
    } else {
        // Internal issue - should never occur
        console.log("Quote unsubscribe failed");
    }
})
.catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error);
});
```

#### Order executions

The order execution events are published when there is a change in portfolio positions.

Required scope: “read” or “write”.

Configure the callback using this code:

```javascript
connection.on("OrderExecution", function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

Subscribing to order events, modifications and executions is combined, using this code:

```javascript
connection.invoke("SubscribeOrders", accountNumber)
.then(function (subscriptionResponse) {
    if (subscriptionResponse.isSucceeded) {
        console.log("Subscribed to order events.");
    } else {
        console.log("Error. Is accountNumber valid for this session?");
    }
})
.catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error);
});
```

Stop listening to the order broadcast can be achieved by invoking UnSubscribeOrders (no account number).

#### Order modifications

The order modification events are send when the pending order is modified by the customer.

Required scope: “read” or “write”.

Configure the callback using this code:

```javascript
connection.on("OrderStatus", function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

#### Order changes

The order change events are send when the order is placed, (partially) executed, or cancelled, etc.
These updates are not as detailed as in the orders endpoint, so requesting the order data from the API might be necessary.

Required scope: “read” or “write”.

Configure the callback using this code:

```javascript
connection.on("OrderModified", function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

### <a name="realtime5"></a>Step 5: Extend the subscription before the token expires

The realtime feed will stop after the token has been expired. When the application has refreshed the token, there is a need to extend the subscription.

See the documentation of the [OAuth2 flow](#logon5) on how to handle a token refresh.

Extend the subscription using this code:

```javascript
connection.invoke("ExtendSubscriptions", "{NEW_TOKEN_RETRIEVED_FROM_LOGIN.BINCK.COM}")
.then(function () {
    console.log("Session extended.");
})
.catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error);
});
```

### <a name="realtime6"></a>Step 6: Description of the data

#### News-object

A news object is structured as following:

```javascript
{
    "cul": "nl-BE", // Culture of the news message
    "dt": "2019-04-23T18:25:43.511Z", // Publishing datetime
    "head": "Title", // Subject, unformatted
    "body": "Body", // News body (optional)
    "fmt": "html", // Format of the body
    "iids": ["instrumentId"] // Array of instrument ids
}
```

**cul (culture)** The messages can be in different cultures, depending on the news subscription of the customer.\
**dt** The datetime the message was published, in UTC format.\
**head** The subject of the message. If prefixed with an *, probably it is only a header. This is the journalist working on a news message, sending the headlines in front.
The * is just a standard. If the message is only a headline, there is no body property.\
**body** Optional news message. Can come in HTML format or plain text, depending on the news supplier.\
**fmt (format)** Format of the body. Can be ‘html’ or ‘plain’.\
**iids (instrument ids)** If the message is applicable for one or more tradable instruments, this array contains the instrument ids.

#### Order-object

An order object is structured as following:

```javascript
{
    "accountNumber": "accountNumber",  // Account
    "number": orderNumber,  // Together with account, this identifies the order
    "referenceId": "external reference"  // This can be your reference, provided with an order
    "instrument": {
        "id": "instrumentId"  // Instrument id
    },
    "status": "placed",  // New order status, like “placed”, or “canceled”
    "limitPrice": 5,  // New limit price, if applicable
    "type": "orderType",  // Order type, like “limit”
    "expirationDate": "2019-01-16T00:00:00Z",  // Date when order expires
    "dt": "2019-01-16T10:21:28Z"  // Date when order was placed
}
```

The status can be one of the following:

- placed: It is a new order
- canceled: Order has been canceled
- expired: Order is expired
- completelyExecuted: Order is completely executed
- partiallyExecuted: Applicable when order is executed in multiple parts
- remainderExecuted: Applicable when order is executed in multiple parts

#### Quote-object

A quote object is structured with an array of quote objects, as following:

```javascript
{
    "id": "instrumentId", // Instrument id
    "lvl": 0, // Subscription level of customer
    "sdt": "2019-04-23T18:25:43.511Z", // Time of sending packet
    "qt": [{
        "msg": "qu", // Quote Init, or Quote Update
        "typ": "lst", // Last, High, Low, Close, Open, etc.
        "prc": 7.78, // New price
        "vol": 100, // Volume
        "ord": 3, // Order size (book)
        "dt": "2019-04-23T18:25:43.511Z", // Generation datetime
        "tags": "C"  // Optional flag for (C)ancel, (M)arket, etc.
    }]
}
```

**msg (message)** This property is used to differentiate between object formats.

- qi: An initial quote, used to populate the page. By populating from SDI, a possible gap in the quotes is prevented. Highlighting is not needed.
- qu: A quote update. Highlighting can be done.

The initial quote is send to prevent empty quotes and possible gaps. But, an update might arrive before the initial quote. If this is the case, ignore the initial quote.

**typ (type)** The type of quote, where to differentiate the following types:

- lst: Last price
- vol: Cumulative volume of the day
- cls: Close price
- opn: Opening price
- hgh: Highest price of the day
- low: Lowest price of the day
- bid: The bid price
- ask: Ask price
- thp: Theoretical price
- ivl: Implied volatility
- idv: Implied div
- iir: Implied IR
- set: Settlement price
- oir: Open interest rate

**id (identification)** The hashed instrument id.

**prc (price)** This property has the price of the instrument. Zero for cumulative volumes.

**vol (volume)** This property contains the amount of traded instruments. Zero for non-tradeable instruments like indices, and zero for close, open, high and low prices.

**dt (datetime)** This property contains the date and time of the price, in local time of the market.

**tags** A quote might be taged with one of the following tags:

- C (cancel): A new cycle will start. The quotes for the instrument must be removed.
- M (market): Show the maket indicator in the bid and ask cells.
- O (open): Show an open indicator.
- E (exclude): Exclude this quote from intraday charts, but show in overview lists.

### <a name="realtime7"></a>Step 7: Production

The production environment is the same as sandbox, only with real customers and live data.

Use this URL: `https://realtime.binck.com/stream/v1/`

Example code (in JavaScript) can be found on GitHub: <https://github.com/binckbank-api/client-js>.

### <a name="realtimeSuggestions"></a>Things to keep in mind developing the API

1. Testing the connection can be done using the version endpoint: <https://realtime.sandbox.binck.com/version>.
